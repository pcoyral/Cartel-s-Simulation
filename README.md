# Cartel-s-Simulation
It is the simulation of a cartel from growing the coca leaf to the distribution of the cocaine with distribution.
The first objective was to make different classes for different roles in the cartel.
The Farmers class is used to lant the seeds, collect the leafs and move them in a leaf storage.
The Chemist class is used to convert the leafs in cocaine and store it.
Then the distribution class takes the cocaine from the storage and distribute it somewhere that we can set up later.
In the futur we would like to implement 2 things. A bank acount that will receive money for avery distributed cocaine and pay the seeds and workers after a certain period of time (eg. every minute). Moreover we would like to add a probability to be caught by the police, army... for each type of transportation. Finally it could be interesting to add destination of the cocaine so it oesn't take the same time for a plane to go from columbia to berlin than going to canada.
